Python Sudoku Solver
This project is a Python implementation of a Sudoku Solver which utilizes the backtracking algorithm. You will input numbers to create the board, and the solver will produce the correct solution to the puzzle.

Features
User Input: You will input numbers to create the board. Use 0 for empty cells.
Sudoku Solver: The solver will produce the correct solution to the puzzle using the backtracking algorithm.
Techniques and Skills
Python Programming: The solver is entirely written in Python.
Backtracking Algorithm: The backtracking algorithm is used to solve the Sudoku puzzle.
Functions: The solver logic is divided into several functions for better organization and readability.
Input/Output: The input function is used to get the user’s input for the board and the print function is used to display the board and messages.
To run the solver, follow these steps:
Ensure that Python 3 is installed on your machine. You can check this by running python --version in your terminal/command prompt. If Python is correctly installed, you should see your Python version.
Clone the repository or download the Python file containing the solver code.
Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the Python file.
Run the command python filename.py, replacing “filename” with the name of the Python file.
The solver will prompt you to enter nine values for each row, separated by spaces. Enter the numbers and the solver will start.
The solver will display the original board and the solved board. The first board to be solved wins the game.
